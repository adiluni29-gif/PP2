# Python Classes/Objects

    # Python is an object oriented programming language.
    # Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
    # A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# To create a class, use the keyword class:


# Create a Class
# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5



# Create a Class
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)


# Delete Objects
# You can delete objects by using the del keyword:

# Delete the p1 object:
del p1


# Multiple Objects
# You can create multiple objects from the same class:

# Create three objects from the MyClass class:

p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x)


# The pass Statement
# class definitions cannot be empty,
# but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
