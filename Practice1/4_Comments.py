#Creating a Comment
#Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

#Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#if the line is commented out, the commands where the commands are written will not work.
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

#Multiline Comment
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

#or you can use triple quotes
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
